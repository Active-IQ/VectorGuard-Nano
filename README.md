Free, open-source (MIT) plugin/skill that adds simple, reversible string obfuscation to OpenClaw agents — great for secure Moltbook posts, Telegram chats, IPFS links, etc.

The full **VectorGuard** (model-bound cryptography, fractal recursion, tiny-model entropy sync, sovereign identity) is a proprietary product.
